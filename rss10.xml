      <title>Divyanshu Thakur (divyanshu132): GSoC 2019 - Week 4 - Phase-I Completion</title>
      <pubDate>Mon, 24 Jun 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
      <link>https://divyanshu132.github.io//gsoc-week-4</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The fourth week of coding period has ended and now it&amp;#8217;s time for phase-I evaluations. Below, is a brief progress report of the project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tasks that were proposed in the proposal for phase-I consists of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Implementation of Abelian Invariants&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Implementation of Composition Series&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Computation with Polycyclic groups&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abelian Invariants&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Implemented a function to compute the abelian invariants for a given permutation or free group. These are given as a list of prime-powers and describe the stucture of &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;G/G'&lt;/code&gt; as a direct product of cyclic groups of prime power order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;PR link &lt;a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/16670"&gt;Added method to calculate Abelian Invariants&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Composition Series&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Implemented a function to compute the composition series. It provides a way to break up a group into simple pieces. Composition series of a group &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;G&lt;/code&gt; is defined as the maximal subnormal series &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;G = H_0 &amp;gt; H_1 &amp;gt; H_2 ... &amp;gt; H_k = 1&lt;/code&gt; where every factor group &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;H(i+1)/H(i)&lt;/code&gt; is simple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;PR link &lt;a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/16881"&gt;Added method for Composition Series computation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Polycyclic Groups&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The work on polycyclic group is in progress. For now, collection algorithm has been implemented which needs to be tested and a lot of discussions were made on the polycyclic generating sequence and its presentation and may be in a week we&amp;#8217;ll be ready with the stucture of polycyclic groups and collection of words.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;PR link &lt;a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/16991"&gt;Added Polycyclic Group Class&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Documentation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some documentation is done to increase the sphinex coverage of SymPy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;PR link &lt;a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/16809"&gt;Increase Accessibility of docstrings from Sphinx&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To follow the discussion on above topics and the further progress of the project one can check Gitter room &lt;a href="https://gitter.im/sympy/GroupTheory"&gt;sympy/GroupTheory&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Ishan Joshi (ishanaj): GSoC&#x2019;19: Week-4-Starting with Column Buckling implementation</title>
      <pubDate>Sun, 23 Jun 2019 18:41:36 GMT</pubDate>
      <link>https://ishanaj.wordpress.com/2019/06/24/gsoc19-week-4-starting-with-column-buckling-implementation/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Finalizing what had been discussed in &lt;a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/16964"&gt;PR #16964&lt;/a&gt; for integrating geometry module with the beam module,&lt;a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/17055"&gt; PR #17055&lt;/a&gt; was opened which is now ready to go!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no special function for defining the cross-section of a Beam object. A user can simply pass the geometry object as a parameter instead of the &lt;strong&gt;second_moment, &lt;/strong&gt;and the corresponding second moment would be calculated internally. The example below might explain this better:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="brush: python; collapse: false; title: ; wrap-lines: false; notranslate"&gt;

&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; b = Beam(l, E, Circle((0, 0), r))

&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; b.second_moment

pi*r*Abs(r)**3/4

&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; b.cross_section

Circle(Point2D(0, 0), r)

&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, the &lt;strong&gt;cross_section&lt;/strong&gt; attribute can be changed even after the beam is created. Every time the &lt;strong&gt;cross_section&lt;/strong&gt; is assigned a new value, the &lt;strong&gt;second_moment&lt;/strong&gt; gets automatically updated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, every time the user changes the &lt;strong&gt;second_moment&lt;/strong&gt; explicitly after the creation of the beam, the previous &lt;strong&gt;cross_section&lt;/strong&gt; gets destroyed, or in other words, the &lt;strong&gt;cross_section&lt;/strong&gt; is set to None.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="brush: python; collapse: false; title: ; wrap-lines: false; notranslate"&gt;

&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; b = Beam(l, E, Circle((0, 0), r))

&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I&amp;#160; = Symbol(&amp;#8216;I&amp;#8217;)

&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; b.second_moment = I

&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; b.cross_section

None

&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; b.second_moment = Polygon((0, 0), (a, 0), (a, b), (0, b))

ValueError: To update cross-section geometry use `cross_section` attribute

&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The PR is complete and just needs the final approval from the mentors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simultaneously, I had worked on the column buckling calculations which is a part of the stage &amp;#8211;II.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have opened an &lt;a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/issues/17072"&gt;issue-cum-discussion&lt;/a&gt; for discussing its API and further implementations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the calculations of the Column Buckling are very much different from those of beam bending, we will have to make a separate class Column. The basic API and the way the calculations are supposed to go can be seen from the stage &amp;#8211;II in the &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LOtMTr9cCrzQ8_OnKrgkZs8wFS9N9PxlR10h3aKG0jg/edit?usp=sharing"&gt;proposal&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would be making a PR for column buckling calculations within a day or two, once some initial questions (as mentioned in the issue-cum-discussion) gets clarified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Next Week:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finalizing the basic API and implementations of Column class&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Making a PR for the above implementations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Documentation and testing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will keep you updated!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Gagandeep Singh (czgdp1807): Week 4 - Phase 1 Ends</title>
      <pubDate>Sun, 23 Jun 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
      <link>https://czgdp1807.github.io/week_4/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;So, with the fourth week, the first phase of my journey with &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;SymPy&lt;/code&gt; has come to an end. This blog post summarises the work done till now, in terms of PRs. Moreover, I will share with you the plans for phase 2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I worked on the following PRs(listed in chronological order) during the first phase, many of them got merged and few are open.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Merged&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/16528"&gt;#16528&lt;/a&gt; : I worked on extending the &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;GumbelDistribution&lt;/code&gt; to  support both minimum and maximum versions of it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/16576"&gt;#16576&lt;/a&gt;: This PR added &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;Dirichlet&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;MultivariteEwens&lt;/code&gt; distributions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/16808"&gt;#16808&lt;/a&gt; : This PR added &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;Multinomial&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;NegativeMultinomial&lt;/code&gt; distribution.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/16810"&gt;#16810&lt;/a&gt; : This PR improved the API of &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;Sum&lt;/code&gt; by allowing &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;Range&lt;/code&gt; as the limits.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/16825"&gt;#16825&lt;/a&gt; : This PR in continuation, added &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;GeneralizedMultivariateLogGamma&lt;/code&gt; distribution. This was an interesting one due to the complexity involved in its PDF.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/16834"&gt;#16834&lt;/a&gt; : This PR enhanced the &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;Multinomial&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;NegativeMultinomial&lt;/code&gt; distributions by allowing symbolic dimensions for them.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/16897"&gt;#16897&lt;/a&gt; : This was related to &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;sympy.core&lt;/code&gt; and it helped in removing disparity in the results of special function &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;gamma&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/16899"&gt;#16899&lt;/a&gt; : This was a workflow related to PR to ignore the &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;.vscode&lt;/code&gt; folder.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/16908"&gt;#16908&lt;/a&gt; : This PR improved &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;sympy.stats.frv&lt;/code&gt; by allowing conditions with foriegn symbols.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/16913"&gt;#16913&lt;/a&gt; : This removed the unreachable code from &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;sympy.stats.frv&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/16914"&gt;#16914&lt;/a&gt; : This PR allowed symbolic dimensions to &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;MultivariateEwens&lt;/code&gt; distribution.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/16929"&gt;#16929&lt;/a&gt; : This one was for the &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;sympy.tensor&lt;/code&gt; module. It optimized the &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;ArrayComprehension&lt;/code&gt; and covered some corner cases.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/16981"&gt;#16981&lt;/a&gt; : This PR added the architecture of stochastic processes. It also added discrete Markov chain to &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;sympy.stats&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/17003"&gt;#17003&lt;/a&gt; : This PR ignored the &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;__pycahce__&lt;/code&gt; folder by adding it &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;.gitignore&lt;/code&gt; file.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/17030"&gt;#17030&lt;/a&gt; : Some features like, &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;joint_dsitribution&lt;/code&gt; were added in this PR.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/17046"&gt;#17046&lt;/a&gt; : Some common properties of discrete Markov chains, like fundamental matrix, fixed row vector were added.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Open&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/16962"&gt;#16962&lt;/a&gt; : The aim of this PR is to allow symbolic dimensions to single finite distributions, like &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;Die&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;Binomial&lt;/code&gt;. The work from my side is complete on this.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/16934"&gt;#16934&lt;/a&gt; : This PR aims to fix the bugs and test the code introduced in &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;GSoC&lt;/code&gt; 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from the above PRs I also reviewed code written by other contributors.
Overall, according to me phase 1 was a great learning and working experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me share with you my plan for phase 2. Since, I will be working on random matrices during the upcoming phase, I have started the discussions for design with my mentors and things are taking shape. However, apart from random matrices, I will also work on few more general improvements for my phase 1 work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The outline is given below,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I will work on extending the scope of queries handeled by discrete Markov chains by covering some uncommon cases.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some work will be done to extend the &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;DiscreteMarkovChain&lt;/code&gt; by adding &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;ContinuousMarkovChain&lt;/code&gt; as the latter is almost same but with some extra parameters.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I will implement random matrices and its various Gaussian ensembles according to the conclusion of the design discussions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Last but not the least, I will try to merge my open PRs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading and see you soon in phase 2. Bye!!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Phase I has ended and here are the details of the PRs I have raised: #16935 #16843 #16848 #16858 #16886 #16888 #16970 #17004 #17033 #17036 #17068 #17070 #17076 #17077 Many of the above PRs are merged and some are open. I will work to get other merged. My plan for second phase: Complete the sampling method and finish the exporting of random variables to external libraries. I will work on Compound distributions and will finish it in the phase 2. I will add Wishart and Inverse Wishart distributions after multigamma function is merged. I will also discuss the implementation of Random Walks and will start working on the PR. This phase was a great learning experience. That&amp;#8217;s all from my side. Namaste!</description>

      <title>Jogi Miglani (jmig5776): GSoC 2019 - Week 4</title>
      <pubDate>Sat, 22 Jun 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
      <link>https://jmig5776.github.io//gsoc-week-4</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This was the fourth week meeting with the GSoC mentors which was scheduled on
Sunday 22th June, 2019 between 12:30 - 01:30 PM (IST). Me and Yathartha
were the attendees of the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Discussing previous week&amp;#8217;s progress&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the previous week many things happened very suddenly. In the starting of the
week it was decided that we had to create a function &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;power_list&lt;/code&gt; which could
return powers. So I thought to create this type of function as a new feature in
this PR &lt;a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/17043"&gt;#17043&lt;/a&gt;.
But as @jksoum and @smichr advised that this function can act as
helper function in &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;bivariate&lt;/code&gt; itself so it was decided to make it as helper
function there. And we discussed the code for handling modular equations also.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Next week goals&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Implementing and get plan for defining imageset union&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As per the timeline we decided that Imageset Union should be defined first rather
than code for handling nested trigonometric equation solver. So according to
timeline this week goes for discussion and getting plan for implementing imageset
union. A PR &lt;a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/17079"&gt;#17079&lt;/a&gt; is also started
based on fundamental approach to solve the problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Getting merge Lambert Solver&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the work had been done only a little improvement is to be done in &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;power_list&lt;/code&gt;
function. Hope it gets merged by this week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Code improvement takes time!!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;See the &lt;a href="https://anpandey.github.io/2019-06-07-week-2.html"&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt; for Week 2&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent a large part of last week travelling, so I&amp;#8217;m combining the blog posts for the last two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="finishing-up-with-lfortran"&gt;Finishing up with LFortran&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m finished with the &lt;a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/16931"&gt;pull request&lt;/a&gt; for the LFortran code printer for now, though it&amp;#8217;s definitely way too incomplete to be merged. The code passes &lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt; of the rudimentary tests I&amp;#8217;ve added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s a simple example of one of the failing LFortran tests: Suppose we want to generate Fortran (using LFortran) code from the mathematical expression &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;&amp;#8197;&amp;#8722;&amp;#8197;&lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. SymPy sees this expression as multiplication with -1, as it implements only addition and multiplication in its arithmetic operations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"&gt;&lt;pre class="sourceCode python"&gt;&lt;code class="sourceCode python"&gt;&lt;a class="sourceLine" id="cb1-1" title="1"&gt;&lt;span class="op"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="im"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; sympy &lt;span class="im"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="op"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a class="sourceLine" id="cb1-2" title="2"&gt;&lt;span class="op"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; x &lt;span class="op"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; Symbol(&lt;span class="st"&gt;'x'&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a class="sourceLine" id="cb1-3" title="3"&gt;&lt;span class="op"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; srepr(&lt;span class="op"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;x)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a class="sourceLine" id="cb1-4" title="4"&gt;&lt;span class="co"&gt;&amp;quot;Mul(Integer(-1), Symbol('x'))&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Directly converting same mathematical expression in Fortran as &lt;code&gt;-x&lt;/code&gt; we can see that LFortran instead sees it as unary subtraction:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"&gt;&lt;pre class="sourceCode python"&gt;&lt;code class="sourceCode python"&gt;&lt;a class="sourceLine" id="cb2-1" title="1"&gt;&lt;span class="op"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="im"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; lfortran &lt;span class="im"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="op"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a class="sourceLine" id="cb2-2" title="2"&gt;&lt;span class="op"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; src_to_ast(&lt;span class="st"&gt;&amp;quot;-x&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="va"&gt;False&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a class="sourceLine" id="cb2-3" title="3"&gt;&lt;span class="op"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;lfortran.ast.ast.UnaryOp &lt;span class="bu"&gt;object&lt;/span&gt; at &lt;span class="bn"&gt;0x7f9027f1aba8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="op"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a major problem for the tests, which right now look to see if the Lfortran-parsed output of &lt;code&gt;fcode&lt;/code&gt; (SymPy&amp;#8217;s current Fortran code generator) on an expression matches the same directly translated AST. This won&amp;#8217;t be true for &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;&amp;#8197;&amp;#8722;&amp;#8197;&lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, since the translated expression is a multiplication &lt;code&gt;BinOp&lt;/code&gt; while the parsed expression in an &lt;code&gt;UnaryOp&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One solution might be to not parse &lt;code&gt;fcode&lt;/code&gt;&amp;#8217;s output and instead just check for equivalence between strings. This would mean dealing with the quirks of the code printers (such as their tendency to produce excessive parenthesis), and take away some of the advantages of direct translation. The more probable solution would be to introduce substitution rules within the LFortran AST.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="missing-matrix-nodes"&gt;Missing matrix nodes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I filed issue &lt;a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/issues/17006"&gt;#17006&lt;/a&gt;, in which &lt;code&gt;lambdify&lt;/code&gt; misinterpreted identity matrices as the imaginary unit. The fix in &lt;a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/17022"&gt;#17022&lt;/a&gt; is pretty simple: just generate identity matrices with &lt;code&gt;np.eye&lt;/code&gt; when we can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also went through the matrix expression classes to see which ones weren&amp;#8217;t supported by the NumPy code printer and filed issue &lt;a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/issues/17013"&gt;#1703&lt;/a&gt;. These are addressed by another contributor in &lt;a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/17029%5D"&gt;#17029&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="rewriting-matrix-inversion"&gt;Rewriting matrix inversion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of this week was spent on implementing an optimization for the NumPy generator suggested by Aaron: given the expression &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;&lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&amp;#8197;&amp;#8722;&amp;#8197;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;em&gt;b&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt; where &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;&lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt; is a square matrix and &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;&lt;em&gt;b&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt; a vector, generate the expression &lt;code&gt;np.linalg.solve(A, b)&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;np.linalg.inv(A) * b&lt;/code&gt;. While both &lt;code&gt;solve&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;inv&lt;/code&gt; use the same LU-decomposition based LAPACK &lt;a href="http://www.netlib.org/lapack95/DOC/la_gesv.txt"&gt;&lt;code&gt;?gesv&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; functions &lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="https://anpandey.github.io/atom-sympy.xml#fn1" id="fnref1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;code&gt;solve&lt;/code&gt; is called on a vector while the &lt;code&gt;inv&lt;/code&gt; on a (much larger) matrix. In addition to cutting down on the number of operations, this optimization might also remove any errors introduced in calculating the inverse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My pull request for this optimization is available at &lt;a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/17041"&gt;#17041&lt;/a&gt;, which uses SymPy&amp;#8217;s assumption system to make sure that &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;&lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt; is full-rank (a constraint imposed by &lt;code&gt;solve&lt;/code&gt;). My initial approach was to embed these optimizations directly in the code printing base classes. After some discussion with Bj&amp;#246;rn, we decided it would be better to separate optimization from printing as much as possible, leading to the representation of the solving operation as its own distinct AST node. This approach is much better than the original, since it was fairly easy to the optimization to the Octave/Matlab code printer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="next-steps"&gt;Next Steps&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this week, I&amp;#8217;ll be continuing with the matrix optimization PR. I&amp;#8217;ll try to find other optimizations that can be applied (such as the evaluation order of complicated matrix expressions) and look into using Sympy&amp;#8217;s unification capabilities in simplifying the expression of optimization rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section class="footnotes"&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can find the C definitions for the functions eventually called by &lt;a href="https://github.com/numpy/numpy/blob/b80d360e/numpy/linalg/umath_linalg.c.src#L1694"&gt;&lt;code&gt;inv&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://github.com/numpy/numpy/blob/b80d360e/numpy/linalg/umath_linalg.c.src#L1622"&gt;&lt;code&gt;solve&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. These are written in a special templated version of C, but you can find the &lt;a href="https://github.com/numpy/numpy/blob/b80d360e/numpy/linalg/umath_linalg.c.src#L1560"&gt;template variable definitions&lt;/a&gt; a bit higher up in the source.&lt;a class="footnote-back" href="https://anpandey.github.io/atom-sympy.xml#fnref1"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Week 3 ends.. - 
          Week 3 of the first phase of this coding period is coming to an end. The week started with a bad note, given that I had fallen sick due to travelling. But the work in Week 2, and the meeting with Sartaj on 11th of June helped me to progress...</description>

      <title>Divyanshu Thakur (divyanshu132): GSoC 2019 - Week 3 - Polycyclic Groups</title>
      <pubDate>Mon, 17 Jun 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
      <link>https://divyanshu132.github.io//gsoc-week-3</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The third week has ended and a good amount of work has been done on polycyclic groups PR &lt;a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/16991"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. The collection algorithm has been implemented, from the beginning of the week, I started with understanding the algorithm which took some time and then finally it was implemented, still we are facing a problem in type conversion(&lt;a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/16991#discussion_r294054681"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) but that will be sorted out soon!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though only two weeks were alloted for polycyclic group implementation but it seems we need one more week or maybe more than a week to implement more functionalities for pc groups. But it&amp;#8217;s completely fine because we started work early and according to the proposed timeline we still have one week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Few of the issues with the current implementation which needs to be sorted out are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;firstly to &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;compute uncollected subwords&lt;/code&gt; the word is manipulated using its &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;array_form&lt;/code&gt; which eventually leads to change in the type of the subwords computed and it creates a problem in processing these subwords further.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Some more issues were pointed out by Kalevi and can be seen in the comments of the PR.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The complete week was spent implementing collection of words so a lot of tasks targeted last week were not completed, I&amp;#8217;ll try to cover those tasks in the upcomming week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Solve the issues with collection of words.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Get ready with the pc presentation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Till then, Good byee..!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The third week of coding period has ended and as I already stated in the last blog, I couldn&amp;#8217;t be much productive this week. Nevertheless, I tried to wrap-up some unfinished works. PR &lt;a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/16956"&gt;#16956&lt;/a&gt; is ready to merge, just waiting for some last reviews. This PR needs to be supplemented with some fixes in the code of &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;Add&lt;/code&gt; class to handle all the issues over &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;Relationals&lt;/code&gt;. PR &lt;a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/16978"&gt;#16978&lt;/a&gt; had one major failing test from the &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;stats&lt;/code&gt; module. I tried to debug it ,but due to my unfamiliarity with that part of code I took help from &lt;a href="https://github.com/czgdp1807"&gt;Gagandeep&lt;/a&gt; and as his &lt;a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/16978#discussion_r294039337"&gt;comment&lt;/a&gt; suggests, the result this PR is giving is correct and more intuitive. At least, one less issue to handle &amp;#128524;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the end of the week, I shifted my focus towards &lt;em&gt;New Assumptions&lt;/em&gt;. One of my major tasks for this summer is to speed up the &lt;em&gt;satask&lt;/em&gt; module. As suggested by Aaron, I searched the repository for issues and PRs over this, and I found a number of such unfinished work. I would need to study these ideas and profile the results before working ahead. I would create a issue-tree over it connecting all such PRs and there respective benchmarks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this week, I would focus on the above mentioned task only. Since the first phase is about to end, I would have to speed things up.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Zhiqi KANG (kangzhiq): [GSoC 2019] WEEK 3!</title>
      <pubDate>Sun, 16 Jun 2019 22:11:07 GMT</pubDate>
      <link>https://www.kangzhiq.com/2019/06/17/gsoc-2019-week-3/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello, the third week ends! I am a little bit too busy to keep contributing on my GSoC project as the first two weeks. Fortunately, thank to the work of the past 2 weeks and the help of my mentors, I become more productive which compensates, more or less,  the lack of time.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Overview&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The task about sparse arrays nearly comes to an end which is the main goal for the first phase. I still have one case to be fixed but most of them are merged in to Sympy&amp;#8217;s master and are ready to be used. I started as well preparing for the next task: implementing more data structure for sparse arrays. This would be started in the next week and is supposed to be ended by the begining of phase 2.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;PRs&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Several PR are merged this week for sparse arrays operations.  &lt;a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/16937"&gt;#16937&lt;/a&gt;  is finally merged with a code style much simpler than its first version.  &lt;a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/16994"&gt;#16994&lt;/a&gt;  about __mul__ and __rmul__ is closed and replaced by &lt;a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/17014"&gt;#17014&lt;/a&gt; due to a mistake about rebase. &lt;a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/17026"&gt;#17026&lt;/a&gt;  about __div__ and __neg__ operators for sparse arrays is opened and merged.  &lt;a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/17035"&gt;#17035&lt;/a&gt; about permutedims and transpose for sparse arrays is opened and reviewed by my mentor.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Issues&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;No specific issue opened. The list in &lt;a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/issues/16941"&gt;#16941&lt;/a&gt; is continously being updated.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Reviews&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;No review due to the lack of time.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Related works&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Pratice of rebasing and merging for a specific case: updated local repository from the upstream master after opening a PR. Even though I have broken the PR  &lt;a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/16994"&gt;#16994&lt;/a&gt;, I am still happy to learn some new tricks that I didn&amp;#8217;t know before.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Preparing a blog about presenting sparse array associated with my work in SymPy so that my contribution can indeed help people when they need to use this class but don&amp;#8217;t really know how to do it and what the advantage would be .&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Ishan Joshi (ishanaj): GSoC&#x2019;19: Week 3 &#x2013; Wrapping up Stage-I</title>
      <pubDate>Sun, 16 Jun 2019 19:20:32 GMT</pubDate>
      <link>https://ishanaj.wordpress.com/2019/06/17/gsoc19-week-3-wrapping-up-stage-i/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week started with working on &lt;a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/17001"&gt;PR #17001&lt;/a&gt;. The algorithm was extended to handle concave polygons as well. I came up with a new method which I have explained in the &lt;a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/wiki/A-method-to-return-a-cut-section-of-any-polygon-geometry"&gt;wiki page&lt;/a&gt; that I have created. It has to be tested against some symbolic coordinates to make it a complete method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The API of the CrossSection class has been changed as discussed in the last week. The documentation of the class has been completed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were some discussions being done on the necessity and the importance of the CrossSection class. Despite the CrossSection class providing some very useful functionalities of calculating the section modulus, the first moment of area and polar modulus, is there really a need for such a class? After getting some pros and cons listed out we got to a conclusion, that it would probably be better to add these functionalities directly to the geometry module.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the question of complex geometries like T-shape and I-shape still remains. The alternative to this that we came up with in the discussion was Boolean operations on simple polygons. There are some clipping algorithms like Vatti algorithm and Greiner Hormann algorithm which might be helpful in implementing these.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, this is what is left to be done:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Transferring the cross-sectional properties defined in the CrossSection class to the geometry module&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Making the beam class to accept any geometry instead of the second moment that is currently accepted from the user.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In later stages, I might try to work on the Boolean operations as currently there is a limitation of time and the implementation of the stage -II awaits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After this, the stage-I would end and I will have to start with the next implementation i.e. the column buckling calculations&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Next Week:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Completing leftovers of the previous week&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Starting off with stage-II&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The work and the progress during the stage-I were full of ups and downs. Will try to make it smoother this time. Will try to discuss the implementations with the mentors and the members in even more detail. Hope to have a good coding week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will keep you updated!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Gagandeep Singh (czgdp1807): Week 3 - Evaluation is coming :P</title>
      <pubDate>Sun, 16 Jun 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
      <link>https://czgdp1807.github.io/week_3/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Week 3 has ended and we are moving towards phase 1 evaluations by entering the fourth week. Let me tell you what all has been done during the previous week to make the last step smooth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The basic structure of stochastic process has been added with the merging of the PR &lt;a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/16981"&gt;#16981&lt;/a&gt; and I am currently working on adding more features like, &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;joint_distribution&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;expectation&lt;/code&gt; and may be some more according to the suggestions recieved from the community. You can read more about it, &lt;a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/17030#issuecomment-502455179"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. So this was about some processes, now lets move to the case of symbolic dimensions. Well, I made a comment and the members showed agreement to that. I have made some updates to the PR &lt;a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/16962"&gt;#16962&lt;/a&gt; and the summary is available at &lt;a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/16962#issuecomment-502461264"&gt;this comment&lt;/a&gt;. I also discovered that docs of &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;SymPy&lt;/code&gt; weren&amp;#8217;t being updated at &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;https://docs.sympy.org&lt;/code&gt; for the &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;stats&lt;/code&gt; module and therefore I modified the PR &lt;a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/16934"&gt;#16934&lt;/a&gt;. For preparation of phase 2, I have created the issue &lt;a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/issues/17039"&gt;#17039&lt;/a&gt; for discussion on random matrices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what I learnt? Premature optimization is bad for the health of the code. Yes, while reviewing PRs I learnt that concept. I also got to know why some imports cannot be put at the top of the file, all due to a concept called, &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;circular imports&lt;/code&gt;. Sounds intuitive and faced a lot earlier but wasn&amp;#8217;t aware of the exact term. Thanks to &lt;a href="https://github.com/leosartaj"&gt;leosartaj&lt;/a&gt; for this. I also tried the coverage tests on my local system with the help of &lt;a href="https://github.com/oscarbenjamin"&gt;oscarbenjamin&lt;/a&gt;. Read &lt;a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/16981#issuecomment-502095724"&gt;this comment&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#8217;s it for now, bye!!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This was the third week meeting with the GSoC mentors which was scheduled on
Sunday 16th June, 2019 between 12:00 - 01:00 PM (IST). Me, Amit, Yathartha and
Shekhar were the attendees of the meeting. In this meeting mainly it was discussed
to improve the code quality and make routine of independent working code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Code quality&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every programmer should master this skill to write a good quality code. Everything from
naming, documentation to make routines includes in this skill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we discussed mainly the code for the PR &lt;a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/16890"&gt;#16890&lt;/a&gt;
and realising that a new function &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;power_list&lt;/code&gt; to be made to return all the
powers of symbols present in an expression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learning new skills!!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Week 3 has ended and o boy, what a week it has been. I was able to achieve quite a bit this week. Opened a PR for sampling methods, along the lines of Francesco Bonazzi&amp;#8217;s suggestion, and it has well receieved. I will continue my work to more it more robust and avoid code repetition as much as possible. I have started the discussion on Compound distributions and have started an issue regarding the same. I also went through the implementation of Joint distribution to see how it was structured and will take inspiration from it for implementation of Compound distribution. I also raised a PR for Compound distribution and will continue to work on it. In addition I also implemented some more distributions and factorial moment function for statistics module. I will try to get them merged before evaluation begin.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;How did it get so late so soon?&amp;#8221; &amp;#8213; Dr. Seuss
 Welcome everyone, this is your host Nikhil Maan aka Sc0rpi0n101 and we&amp;rsquo;re running late on everything this week. This time we will talk about some operating system stuff along with the week&amp;rsquo;s work. I will have more blogs on operating systems and that type of stuff soon. For now, let&amp;rsquo;s talk about what&amp;rsquo;s happening.
Why so Late?</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The second week of official coding period has concluded. I will give you a brief summary of the week&amp;#8217;s work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started this week with working on PR &lt;a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/16956"&gt;#16956&lt;/a&gt;, the PR is now passing tests. I will try to get it merged soon. Later this week, I tried to include &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;complex -&amp;gt; finite&lt;/code&gt; in the assumptions system. I started PR &lt;a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/16978"&gt;#16978&lt;/a&gt; over this. This PR changes the assumptions system to work over the &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;complex -&amp;gt; finite&lt;/code&gt; clause. All the instances of use of &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;is_complex&lt;/code&gt; call has to be modified. As suggested by Aaron, the &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;is_complex&lt;/code&gt; call was changed with a disjunction of &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;is_complex&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;is_infinite&lt;/code&gt; calls. Luckily for me, the usage of complex assumption was not much in the codebase &amp;#128524;. Though it meant less test failures to handle, the core assumptions system (in the old system) is quite complex to understand and debug, and hence handling all the failing tests proved quite difficult. Also, I tried to work on it without including any new assumptions to the system. One important result of this is, &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;zoo.is_complex&lt;/code&gt; returns &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;False&lt;/code&gt; now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from that I have worked on to sync these changes in the new assumptions system as well and I will be sending PR over it soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the coming week,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I will start to work on SAT solver and to speed it up. As suggested by Aaron, I will first look into the other unfinished PRs over this.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I will sync the new assumptions with the recent developments in the old system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With enough said, these PRs made me realize how much the codebase can break with small changes in the assumptions. Also, I know this post is a little bit late(because of bad health). I have some pending work over from the last week and I will try to catch speed as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Divyanshu Thakur (divyanshu132): GSoC 2019 - Week 2 - Polycyclic Group Presentation in SymPy</title>
      <pubDate>Tue, 11 Jun 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
      <link>https://divyanshu132.github.io//gsoc-week-2</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello world,
The second week of coding period has been ended and for the complete week we worked on the presentation of polycyclic groups. I&amp;#8217;ve created a WIP PR for the basic structure of PcGroups &lt;a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/16991"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; but it seems like there are a lot of things that needs to be changed or enhanced in this presentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Initially I thought of representing PcGroups with just the generators of the given permutation group and then from the last week we already have composition-series(&lt;a href="https://divyanshu132.github.io//gsoc-week-1"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) so we can easily compute the generating sequence(pcgs) for the polycyclic group. But, finally we realised that the composition-series will be too big to do all the computations for the PcGroup. Also, in the presentation we can&amp;#8217;t ignore the relators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, after all this we thought of computing the smaller version of subnormal series with cyclic factors and finally we realised that &lt;strong&gt;collection algorithm&lt;/strong&gt; is something that we need. Can&amp;#8217;t say more about this because I have to look into the &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;rewriting&lt;/code&gt; code which looks like a tough task for me but let&amp;#8217;s hope for the best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the next week I&amp;#8217;m setting these milestones for me:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Get ready with the presentation of PcGroups(still I&amp;#8217;m not sure if collection algorithm is what we need!).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Implement &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;exponent-vector&lt;/code&gt; which may further help in HallSubgroup computation.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Include more methods in the PcGroup class.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Will try my best to execute things in order mentioned above. With this, sign out for the next week.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Zhiqi KANG (kangzhiq): [GSoC 2019] WEEK 2!</title>
      <pubDate>Sun, 09 Jun 2019 22:53:12 GMT</pubDate>
      <link>https://www.kangzhiq.com/2019/06/10/gsoc-2019week-2/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello everyone! I am glad to present some of my progress during this past week.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Overview&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I was mainly working on the sparse aray issue over this week. A sparse array is, by a brief definition, an array in which most of the elements are zero.  In order to save the memory cost, sparse array is distinguished from the dense array(which means most of elements are non-zero) and then is stored and manipulated in a different way. The default data format in SymPy for sparse array is called Dictionary of keys (DOK), where the non-zero value is stored in a dictionary.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, the sparse array is cast to dense array in various ways. So what I am trying to do is to free these sparse arrays and nake good use of them for cases like large scale sparse array operations. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;PRs&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The PR about derive_by_array &lt;a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/16937"&gt;#16937&lt;/a&gt; is not yet merged. Thank to the guidance of my mentor Francesco, the PR is being ameliorated and now has satisfactory result. Besides the operation of derive_by_array, I have updated as well the way Array module perform a equality test and apply function. To show the result of these changes, let&amp;#8217;s see what the behavior of derive_by_array was:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class="wp-block-code"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a = MutableSparseNDimArray.zeros(10000, 20000)
&gt;&gt;&gt; a[1, 1] = i
&gt;&gt;&gt; a[1, 2] = j
&gt;&gt;&gt; d = derive_by_array(a, i)
MemoryError
&gt;&gt;&gt; d = derive_by_array(a, (i, j))
MemoryError&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The sparse array is cast to a list which leads to the MemoryError. Now, we can have:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class="wp-block-code"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a = MutableSparseNDimArray.zeros(10000, 20000)
&gt;&gt;&gt; a[1, 1] = i
&gt;&gt;&gt; derive_by_array(a, i) = ImmutableSparseNDimArray({20001:1},(10000, 20000))
True
&gt;&gt;&gt; a[1, 2] = j
&gt;&gt;&gt; derive_by_array(a, (i, j)) == ImmutableSparseNDimArray({20001: 1, 200020002: 1},(2, 10000, 20000))
True&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The operation is much more rapid and can save a lot of spaces of memory. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Francesco also helped to improve the quality of codes. For example, to perform the deriative of a sparse array, he suggested me to use a dictionary comprehension instead of a for loop, so an extra function is replaced by one single line of code.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A new PR &lt;a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/16994"&gt;#16994&lt;/a&gt; about __mul__ and__rmul__ is opened, which solves the problem of casting in these operators. Same as another new PR &lt;a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/17000"&gt;#17000&lt;/a&gt; for tensorproduct. However, these PRs cannot pass the test for now because the issue about equality test is not yet fixed and merged into master of SymPy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A new PR &lt;a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/16969"&gt;#16969&lt;/a&gt; about adding functions and tests for ArrayComprehension is merged, which added functions like .tomatrix(), .tolist() for this class.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Issues&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I have opened a issue &lt;a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/issues/16984"&gt;#16984&lt;/a&gt; about equality test of Dict and dict objects. I ran into this case while comparing the dictionaries of sparse array. Fortunately, this issue is recently fixed. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Reviews&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;No reviews for other contributors&amp;#8217; PR. I have participated in the review of my own PRs since there are some errors have been found after the creation of PR.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Related works&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I have participated in the discussion about the nature of ArrayComprehension in the community this week. Comprehension is a new class that I implemented last week(See &lt;a href="https://www.kangzhiq.com/2019/06/03/gsoc-week-1/"&gt;last post&lt;/a&gt; for more details) This discussion helped me better understand the difference between a multipledimensional list and an array: an array is suppposed to perform vectorized operations while list is mosyly element-wise.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Ishan Joshi (ishanaj): GSoC&#x2019;19: Week 2 &#x2013; Working on CrossSection class</title>
      <pubDate>Sun, 09 Jun 2019 18:20:25 GMT</pubDate>
      <link>https://ishanaj.wordpress.com/2019/06/09/gsoc19-week-2-working-on-crosssection-class/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The second week has ended and here I am to give you a brief about the week&amp;#8217;s work!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The week started with the opening of a &lt;a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/16964"&gt;PR #16964&lt;/a&gt; which intended to define a class &lt;strong&gt;CrossSection &lt;/strong&gt;as planned. Discussions have been done in this PR regarding its API and its need. All these discussions lead to a conclusion of making a slight change in the API to make it accept any arbitrary cross-section which the user can define using the geometry module. So now the &lt;strong&gt;CrossSection&lt;/strong&gt; class will take the input of a pre-defined object of the geometry module and calculate its corresponding properties. This will make the &lt;strong&gt;CrossSection&lt;/strong&gt; class much simpler and generalized. I will be updating the same in the &lt;strong&gt;PR&lt;/strong&gt; soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had also researched some of the previous works done in this area. &lt;a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/14434"&gt;PR #14434&lt;/a&gt;, which intends to implement a shape class, giving functionality to cut an ellipse or a parabola via a line and determine the properties of the newly formed segment. I have tried to implement a similar concept to the Polygon class via a method &lt;strong&gt;cut_section() &lt;/strong&gt;in &lt;a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/17001"&gt;PR #17001&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also since one of the major issues also was to determine the first moment of area, this PR would further help in the calculation of the first moment of area. It intends to give the Polygon class functionality to return a new Polygon segment formed when a given line intersects the Polygon. Although, an alternative method of &lt;strong&gt;Polygon triangulation&lt;/strong&gt; also has been discussed in this PR, to determine the first moment. I will have to do a bit of research for this to get this implemented&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Next Week:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Implementing a method to determine the first moment of area&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Completing the CrossSection class along with its documentation and testing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Linking it with the beam module&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Working over the implementation of &lt;strong&gt;Stage-II&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will try to make the CrossSection class fully functional, by the end of the coming week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will keep you updated!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Week 2 ends.. - 
          Week 2 of the Coding Period (Phase 1) is coming to an end. This week was mostly devoted towards polishing the existing PRs, and bringing them to a mergeable condition. And this week resulted in the merge of 2 PRs. Yayy !!! Here are the deliverables which have been completed...</description>

      <title>Gagandeep Singh (czgdp1807): Week 2 - A lot of work</title>
      <pubDate>Sun, 09 Jun 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
      <link>https://czgdp1807.github.io/week_2/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week involved a lot of work and reviews. I worked on three PRs this week which were started for the purpose of, Markov chains, symbolic dimensions and symbolic conditions for finite RVs. Let me tell you how I managed all this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most important and the most demanding PR from all the said topics was that of Markov chain. I told you that we were discussing API for the same. Fortunately the discussion concluded and I started implementation with the starting of the second week, by opeining &lt;a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/16981"&gt;#16981&lt;/a&gt;. Infact, the basic structure is ready and I am vary happy, that the code is able to handle &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;probability&lt;/code&gt; queries and is generating desirable results. Out of curiosity, I started work on symbolic dimensions for helping one of my fellow students. Infact, it&amp;#8217;s also going to be completed, see &lt;a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/16962"&gt;#16962&lt;/a&gt;. The work for symbolic conditions which started for the purpose of correcting &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;@XFAIL&lt;/code&gt; tests is also almost complete, take a look at &lt;a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/16908"&gt;#16908&lt;/a&gt;. I have observed that still there are some issues with &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;sympy.stats.frv&lt;/code&gt; which need to be handled in a different set of PRs. Hopefully, I am planning to make some of those this week if time permits. I also aim to add more features to &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;StochasticProcess&lt;/code&gt; like &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;joint_distribution&lt;/code&gt;, and adding more properties to &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;DiscreteMarkovChain&lt;/code&gt; like, whether it&amp;#8217;s absorbing, transient. Adding, &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;ContinuousMarkovChain&lt;/code&gt; will also be on my list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from a lot of work there was a lot of learning too. I got many of my concepts cleared, like, inherit &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;Basic&lt;/code&gt; only when the instance of the class is going to be a part of &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;SymPy&lt;/code&gt; expression. Thanks to &lt;a href="https://github.com/certik"&gt;Ond&amp;#345;ej &amp;#268;ert&amp;#237;k&lt;/a&gt; for this. I also realized the worth of &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;sympy.stats.symbolic_probability&lt;/code&gt; while working on symbolic dimensions. Francesco used to suggest that we should use it wherever necessary, but now I completely understand his view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#8217;s all, thanks for reading. Bye!!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week invovled working on the design of sampling based on external libraries. I opened an issue to discuss my idea about their implementation and got very positive response from the mentors. I also worked to merge previous week PRs and would especially like to thank Sidhant Nagpal for helping me with them. Also while working on one new distribution, I found that incomplete beta function was not implemented and hence raised a PR in this regard. This would be my second function implementation in SymPy. Overall the week was very productive and I hope that I would be able to continue my work in the coming week. That&amp;#8217;s all from my side. Namaste!</description>

      <title>Jogi Miglani (jmig5776): GSoC 2019 - Week 2</title>
      <pubDate>Sat, 08 Jun 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
      <link>https://jmig5776.github.io//gsoc-week-2</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This was the second week meeting with the GSoC mentors which was scheduled on
Saturday 8th June, 2019 between 12:00 - 01:00 PM (IST). Me, Amit, Yathartha and Harsh
were the attendees of the meeting. It was a surprise having Harsh on this meeting.
In this meeting we mainly discussed about how to integrate lambert another way because
the existing method in PR &lt;a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/16890"&gt;#16890&lt;/a&gt; is
not trustworthy and upto the mark. So this week I will try to implement the method
or approach told by Yathartha. Important lesson learned in this meeting was that
the method that I implement should have these following qualities to be a better
software developer:-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Proof Of Correctness&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is very important because I should have a plan before I get to code. Many
things already get straightened up while planning for what to implement and it
ultimately reduces coding time and let us get a more accurate and concrete code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Clean and Understandable Code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This factor is also very important to write a code that is easily understandable.
It is better for us as well as it also persuade new contributors easily who are
willing to contribute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Extensible Code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A well written code is always extensible. Proper techniques should be learned to
write an extensible code rather than a code that looks like patch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this week I also started a PR &lt;a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/16976"&gt;#16976&lt;/a&gt;
to handle modular equations.&lt;br /&gt;
It was a worth it meeting because I got to learn various important and necessary
qualities from all of the mentors. Harsh was also glad that we were trying to focus
on well written clean code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot more to learn and implement :) !!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome everyone, this is your host Nikhil Maan aka Sc0rpi0n101 and this time we will talk about the Week 2 of the coding period for GSoC 2019 and the story of the elusive pull requests which people had to wait almost the whole week for.
The Weekend after the Meeting
A Bad Start
Finally, the Pull Request
The Meeting for the Week
The Next Week
The Weekend after the Meeting The plan for the week was discussed in the meeting held on May 30 which was to post a PR with the Clang work and get on track with LFortran with the developer examples in the developer tutorial and post a PR if possible.</description>

      <title>Ankit Pandey (anpandey): Google Summer of Code: Week 2</title>
      <pubDate>Fri, 07 Jun 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;See the &lt;a href="https://anpandey.github.io/2019-05-31-week-1.html"&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt; for Week 1&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this week, I&amp;#8217;ve continued working on adding support for LFortran to SymPy&amp;#8217;s code generation capabilities. This week mostly involved getting the infrastructure for testing the functionality of the new code generator working. I also extended the number of expressions the generator can handle, in addition to adding to LFortran&amp;#8217;s ability to parse numbers upstream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="more-expressions"&gt;More Expressions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve added support for four more expression types that the generator can handle: &lt;code&gt;Float&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Rational&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Pow&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Function&lt;/code&gt;. Since our base translation class was already in place from last week, implementing these was relatively straightforward and involved just defining the node visitors for each expression type (The commit that implements this can be found &lt;a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/16931/commits/67a06a83d4aa239e8d319837d9ed7d11b67f7846"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). Here&amp;#8217;s a demonstration showing the abstract syntax tree generated from translating the expression &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;$\left(\frac{4}{3}\right)^{x}$&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"&gt;&lt;pre class="sourceCode python"&gt;&lt;code class="sourceCode python"&gt;&lt;a class="sourceLine" id="cb1-1" title="1"&gt;&lt;span class="op"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="im"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; sympy.abc &lt;span class="im"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; x&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a class="sourceLine" id="cb1-2" title="2"&gt;&lt;span class="op"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="im"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; sympy.codegen.lfort &lt;span class="im"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; sympy_to_lfortran&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;a class="sourceLine" id="cb1-20" title="20"&gt;&amp;#9474;   &amp;#9584;&amp;#9472;dims&lt;span class="op"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;[]&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a class="sourceLine" id="cb1-21" title="21"&gt;&amp;#9500;&amp;#9472;op&lt;span class="op"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;operator.Pow&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a class="sourceLine" id="cb1-22" title="22"&gt;&amp;#9500;&amp;#9472;right&lt;span class="op"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;x&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a class="sourceLine" id="cb1-23" title="23"&gt;&amp;#9584;&amp;#9472;type&lt;span class="op"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;ttype.Real&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a class="sourceLine" id="cb1-24" title="24"&gt;  &amp;#9500;&amp;#9472;kind&lt;span class="op"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dv"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a class="sourceLine" id="cb1-25" title="25"&gt;  &amp;#9584;&amp;#9472;dims&lt;span class="op"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;[]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the translator fails for expressions that should in theory work. Right now, we can&amp;#8217;t add an integer to a symbol because symbols default to real numbers, resulting in a type mismatch:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"&gt;&lt;pre class="sourceCode python"&gt;&lt;code class="sourceCode python"&gt;&lt;a class="sourceLine" id="cb2-1" title="1"&gt;&lt;span class="op"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; pprint_asr(sympy_to_lfortran(&lt;span class="dv"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="op"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; x))&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a class="sourceLine" id="cb2-2" title="2"&gt;lfortran.asr.asr_check.TypeMismatch: Type mismatch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortran allows the implicit conversion of a float to a real, and the expression shouldn&amp;#8217;t generate an error. This is functionality that will hopefully be implemented by the time I come back to this project close to the end of the summer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="testing-the-lfortran-converter"&gt;Testing the LFortran Converter&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also added the initial infrastructure for testing the new code generation functions, with the starting commit available &lt;a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/16931/commits/918c12de43e319f8d3f16d48c19f25d1db248909"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. As Aaron mentioned in one of our meetings, the plan right now is for code generated by the LFortran backend to be equivalent to the output generated by the existing &lt;code&gt;fcode&lt;/code&gt; at the AST level. Each test should be in the form of an assertion that tests the (parsed) output of &lt;code&gt;fcode&lt;/code&gt; applied to a SymPy expression against the same AST generated by our newly implemented &lt;code&gt;sympy_to_lfortran&lt;/code&gt;. The LFortran project already has code to check generated ASTs against expected values, so I adapted this to the testing library of our code generator (I&amp;#8217;m also not sure how this works in terms of licensing, since both SymPy and LFortran use the BSD-3 license).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One problem that immediately became apparent was the way that LFortran represents numbers. Looking at the expression tree above, the real numbers are actually stored as strings. On the parser side, LFortran stores a real number as the string used to represent that number. This means that the ASTs of two expressions that represent the same number in different ways are not identical (for example, &lt;code&gt;1.0_dp&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;1.d0&lt;/code&gt; both represent the same double precision floating point number, but the strings stored by LFortran will be different). It&amp;#8217;s only at the &amp;#8220;annotation&amp;#8221; stage of evaluation that LFortran canonicalizes floating point representations. For now, the tests use the annotation function of this stage, and I filed a &lt;a href="https://gitlab.com/lfortran/lfortran/merge_requests/225"&gt;merge request&lt;/a&gt; on the LFortran project to add support for parsing numbers in the way that &lt;code&gt;fcode&lt;/code&gt; generates them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the initial infrastructure is in place, I haven&amp;#8217;t added any tests yet. Since the LFortran project is still in early alpha, the functionality needed to compare the syntax tree made by the builder API against the syntax tree parsed from the output of &lt;code&gt;fcode&lt;/code&gt; hasn&amp;#8217;t been implemented yet. Again, this is something that will hopefully be implemented in LFortran near the end of the summer when I start on this portion of the project again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="contributing-upstream"&gt;Contributing Upstream&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After I filed the merge request to add the functionality I needed to LFortran, Ondr&amp;#780;ej (the creator of LFortran and one of my mentors) mentioned that he was planning on eventually removing the module I contributed to. The merge request I filed actually wasn&amp;#8217;t the one I had in mind at first. I thought about adding support for canonicalizing number nodes right after they&amp;#8217;re created in the builder API, but I decided against this because I felt that any changes I made would have to be minimally invasive. In retrospect, this was probably a misplaced concern, since it&amp;#8217;s important to consider the development stage of a project when deciding how much of it should be changed. Because of this, LFortran will probably end up with something I opted at the moment to not implement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="next-steps"&gt;Next Steps&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#8217;s still some work left to be done with LFortran, such as filing issues I encountered and preparing the pull request for a merge (though it&amp;#8217;ll probably remain a work in progress for some time). After that, I&amp;#8217;ll be finished with LFortran for the time being and move on to extending support for matrix expressions in the Python code generator. The Python code generator can already convert (most) matrix expressions through NumPy, though there are still some bugs owing to an incomplete implementation. For next week, I&amp;#8217;ll have to figure out what this missing functionality is how it can be implemented.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome everyone, this is your host Nikhil Maan aka Sc0rpi0n101 and today I would like to tell you about the Community Bonding Period of GSoC 2019 and also talk about my project and organization in detail.
 GSoC My Project The Organizations Community Bonding Period  GSoC Google Summer of Code (GSoC) is a 12-week program, sponsored by Google to promote open-source among various college students around the world, where the people selected are assigned to projects from different open-source organizations working over the summer contributing to open-source software.</description>

      <title>Divyanshu Thakur (divyanshu132): GSoC 2019 - Week 1 - Composition series computation</title>
      <pubDate>Tue, 04 Jun 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
      <link>https://divyanshu132.github.io//gsoc-week-1</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The coding period has been started from 27 may 2019 and the first week went well. We worked on the composition series computation for solvable groups. I was waiting for the PR to get merged so, that I can include a fully completed PR here &amp;#128578;. Kalevi helped a lot in reviewing and helping me with the algorithm. The PR link is &lt;a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/16881"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Till now, everything is going as it was planned. The abelian invariants PR has been already merged in the community bonding period itself, may be some other time I&amp;#8217;ll discuss about the details of it but for the time being one can look into the PR of abelian invariants &lt;a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/16670"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Composition series of a group &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;G&lt;/code&gt; is defined as the subnormal series &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;G = H_0 &amp;gt; H_1 &amp;gt; H_2 \ldots &amp;gt; H_k = 1&lt;/code&gt; where every factor group
&lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;H(i+1)/H(i)&lt;/code&gt; is simple. The algorithm is described in the implementation itself. We wanted to make sure, the implemeted method work as expected so, I wrote a good amount of tests and examples in the docs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tasks that I&amp;#8217;m hopping to accomplish in the next week are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Discuss with Kalevi about the Polycyclic group implementation.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In the end of the week get ready with WIP PR on pc groups.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopping I&amp;#8217;ll be able to execute things as planned! Till then good bye, keep learning.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The first week of official Coding Period is over and it went well &amp;#128516;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As proposed, I created a branch over &lt;a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/7608"&gt;#7608&lt;/a&gt; and went through it locally. I have made certain improvements and I will create appropriate PR for them this week. I intend to get that merged in this week only, if everything goes well. Also, as suggested by Aaron, I looked for profiling tools for optimizing slow parts in the codebase. I will be using &lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/pyinstrument/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;pyinstrument&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and the profiler of PyCharm for this purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later in this week, I started the PR &lt;a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/16956"&gt;#16956&lt;/a&gt; which fixes issues &lt;a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/issues/16915"&gt;#16915&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/issues/16582"&gt;#16582&lt;/a&gt;. Both these issues are related to assumptions handling in Relationals. It broke more code than expected &amp;#128517;. This shows how embedded the old assumptions are in the codebase. I will try to fix them ASAP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the first week wrapped up, in the next week :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I will create an experimental PR to include &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;complex -&amp;gt; finite&lt;/code&gt; in the old assumptions. This is going to break &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;zoo.is_complex&lt;/code&gt; overall. I will try to do it without including new facts. &lt;a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/16666"&gt;#16666&lt;/a&gt; shows how difficult such proceedings can be.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I will also create a PR to include &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;complex -&amp;gt; finite&lt;/code&gt; in the new assumptions. This should be easier than the former. The new assumptions is still not used much in the codebase &amp;#128524;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will try to shift my focus more towards the new assumptions. But I will also look for any major inconsistency between the assumptions systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this, sign out for the next week.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Zhiqi KANG (kangzhiq): [GSoC 2019] WEEK 1!</title>
      <pubDate>Sun, 02 Jun 2019 22:38:28 GMT</pubDate>
      <link>https://www.kangzhiq.com/2019/06/03/gsoc-week-1/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello everyone! Here comes the end of the first coding week. This blog is dedicated to present the progress that I have had during the past week. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;PRs&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This week the PR about  ArrayComprehension   is merged. &lt;a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/16845"&gt;#16845&lt;/a&gt;. This class is designed as an extension of list comprehension in Python, which enables the list comprehension with symbolic dimensions. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A new PR &lt;a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/16937"&gt;#16937&lt;/a&gt; about the sparse array being cast to dense array in the case of derive_by_array is opened. But somes improvements are still needed. The challenge is to find an approriate method to override and perform a derivative correctly. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Issues&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;An issue &lt;a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/issues/16911"&gt;#16911&lt;/a&gt; is opened. It is in fact a discussion about implementing a NumPy-Like behavior in Array module. It is interesting because my mentor was, at first, not in favor of this implementation. But some differences of behavior between the Array module in SymPy and the one in NumPy did change his mind. So this implementation can be kept in my proposal and will be my tasks for the next phase.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another issue &lt;a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/issues/16941"&gt;#16941&lt;/a&gt; whose aim is to list out all cases where a sparse array is cast to dense arrays is opened this week. Not only as a discussion, this issue would also be a overview of the problems so that the PRs like &lt;a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/16937"&gt;#16937&lt;/a&gt; can refer to it. A checklist is being updated to show the avancement. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Please feel free to comment on the issues or the PRs that I opened. I would love to listen to your opinions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Reviews&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After the merge of ArrayComprehension, another student  &lt;a href="https://github.com/czgdp1807"&gt;Gagandeep Singh&lt;/a&gt;  opened a new PR to ameliorate the code quality of this class. I have also participated as a reviewer to offer some help. I have also leant a lot from the discussion.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Related works&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Not much, due to the burden of projects in college. &lt;/p&gt;</description>
